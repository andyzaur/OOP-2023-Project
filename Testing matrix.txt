- functioneaza

23. As a user, when I add an OUTPUT step I can add information from the previous steps to be added in the file.
- functioneaza dar se baga automat toti pasii facuti pana cand se alege output step (utilizatorul nu poate alege ce pasi sunt sau nu afisati in fisierul de output)

24. As a user, when I want to signal the end of a flow, I need to be able to add an END step.
- functioneaza

25. As a user, when I donâ€™t enter the right information in one of the steps I need to see an error screen with an error message.
- functioneaza daca sunt introduse date de acelasi tip. ( de ex la number input step daca introduc o litera nu va mai functiona, dar daca scriu alt numar functioneaza)

26. As a user, when I see an error screen I need to be able to either retry the step or go to the next one.
- functioneaza (se intoarce automat in meniul cu flow steps)

27. As a user, I want to be able to add a name for each flow that I create.
- functioneaza (in end step cand se salveaza flow-ul)

28. As a user, I want to see when each flow has been created (timestamp).
- functioneaza

29. As a user, I want to be able to run a flow that has been created.
- nu functioneaza (doar sunt afisate)

   1. Completing the action of the step and selecting next
   2. By skipping the step
- nu functioneaza cu flow-uri existente

31. As a user, when I run the flow, I need to go through each of the steps that were added to that flow.
- nu funtioneaza (datele din fiecare flow sunt salvate intr un document txt)

32. As a user, I want to see analytics for each flow:
   1. How many times the flow has been started
   - functioneaza

   2. How many times the flow has been completed
   - functioneaza

   3. How many times each screen has been skipped
   - functioneaza (apare de cate ori a fost ales fiecare step)

   4. Number of error screens displayed for each step
   - nu sunt afisate pentru fiecare step, ci in total

   5. Average number of errors per flow completed
   - nu este afisata media, ci numarul total de erori

33. As a user, I can also delete flows from the system.
- functioneaza

Alte probleme

- in cod sunt caile mele catre fisiere si foldere

- in momentul in care este introdusa o litera in number input se blocheaza

- in momentul in care este introdusa o litera in meniul principal ca input se blocheaza si se goleste fisierul analytics.csv (presupun ca este intr un infinite loop)

- aceeasi eroare este in majoritatea meniurilor cu number input

- nu pot accesa flow-uri existente in niciun mod, doar afisate
